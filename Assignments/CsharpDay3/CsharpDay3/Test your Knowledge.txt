1. Describe the problem generics address.

It addresses the problem of code duplication and lack of type safety when dealing with collections or methods that can operate on any data type. 
This enables type safety and reusability without sacrificing performance.


2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?

List<string> list = new List<string>();


3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?

Two. TKey and TValue.


4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.

True.


5. What method is used to add items to a List object?

Add().


6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.

Remove and RemoveAt.


7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?

following the class name there is something like <T>.


8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.

False. Generic classes can have multiple type parameters.


9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.

True.


10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.

True.
